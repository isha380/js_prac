    The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in. 
    An XHR client exists in one of the following states:

         0 (UNSENT)	The request is created but not yet initialized (open() not called).
         1 (OPENED)	open() has been called, but send() has not been called yet.
         2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED)	send() has been called, and the server has responded with headers.
         3 (LOADING)	The request is in progress; the response is being received but not fully loaded.
         4 (DONE)	The operation is complete, and the response is fully received. -->

   /* XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve 
    data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to 
    update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing

    The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.

    The onreadystatechange property defines a function to be executed when the readyState changes.
