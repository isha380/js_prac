        notes:
        Pointer events, we mostly get browser events and environment events(where is the position of mouse,where did mouse clicked) 
        Why pointer events are better than mouse events ?
    
            Pointer events and mouse events are both used for handling user interactions with a webpage, such as clicks, hover, and scrolling.However, pointer events are generally 
            considered to be better than mouse events for several reasons:
    Pointer events provide a more consistent experience across devices: Pointer events are designed to work with a wide range of input devices, including touchscreens, mouse, and stylus. 
    Pointer events provide more information: Pointer events provide more information about the input device, such as its type (e.g. mouse, touch, pen), pressure, and tilt. 
    Pointer events are more efficient: Pointer events are designed to be more memory-efficient and have lower overhead than mouse events. 
    Pointer events are more flexible: Pointer events are more flexible than mouse events in that they can be used to handle both single and multi-touch interactions.*/
